ExoNet: an AI pipeline to detect exoplanets from transit-survey data using multi-modal features and an interactive web app. ExoNet trains on Kepler, K2, and TESS public catalogs and light-curve windows, combining tabular features (orbital period, depth, duration, radius, SNR) with time-series shape embeddings extracted by a lightweight 1D-CNN. We address label imbalance with stratified sampling and focal loss, and produce calibrated probabilities for three classes: confirmed planet, candidate, false positive. The web interface (Streamlit) allows users to upload new light curves or manual parameters, runs real-time inference, visualizes the folded light curve with the model explanation (SHAP + signal highlights), and exports candidate reports. The repository includes training notebooks, reproducible pipelines, evaluation scripts (ROC/PR curves, confusion matrices), and a small demo dataset so scientists can validate predictions and submit promising candidates for follow-up.
